# advansed-crypto-signal-bot

How to Use:
Install the required dependencies (such as ccxt, numpy, and time).

Define the list of coins you want to track in the COINS variable.

Set the desired time frame, RSI period, and overbought/oversold levels.

Run the script, and it will print trading signals based on divergence and RSI levels for the selected coins.

Notes:
RSI (Relative Strength Index): The script checks whether the RSI value is in the overbought (> 70) or oversold (< 30) zone and prints that information.
Divergence: It looks for a discrepancy between price movement and RSI to identify possible bullish or bearish trends.
ATR: The script uses a simple method based on standard deviation to approximate the Average True Range (ATR) and determine volatility.
